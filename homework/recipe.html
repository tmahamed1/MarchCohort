        <h3><b>Ingredients you will need</b></h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>225g unsalted butter, softened</li> 
            <li>225g caster sugar</li>    
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        </ul>  

        <h3><b>For the drizzle topping you'll need</b></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 and a half lemons, juiced</li>
            <li>85g caster sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <p><b>Steps:</b></p>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.</li>
            <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.</li>
            <li>Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle-
                <br> the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.</li>
            <li>Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days,
                <br> or freeze for up to 1 month.</li>

        </ol>
